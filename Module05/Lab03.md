## Lab03 Wireframe design

Working in teams sketch out a user interface design for a Product Selling application

There is no requirement to use a fancy drawing tool.  That is up to you.

It's probably best to have one person do the drawing for a particular screen layout.  Display it by holding it up to the web cam.  If you don't have a web cam, or don't want to use paper and pencil then you might try `draw.io` as an online tool.

Your application should have the following features:
- product search (just search by keyword)
- product display
- a shopping cart
- a checkout
- order history

Think about:
- how to give your application coherence (convincing the user that they are still in your application and have not just been sent to some random other one)
- how to minimise user input
- following standard conventions (you have had no instruction on such conventions.  What do YOU think they might be?  What makes them standard?)
